Here you can find the repository of the smart contract.

The smart contract project of DEV: The Gathering uses the following tech stack:
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) - Ethereum development environment for professionals;
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript;
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum.

You can check it out the others repositories for the:
- [Web Application](https://github.com/oluaptarso/dev-the-gathering-webapp);
- [Subgraph](https://github.com/oluaptarso/dev-the-gathering-subgraph);
- [Centralized APIs](https://github.com/oluaptarso/dev-the-gathering-server).

There are two smart contracts in the contracts folder:
DevTheGathering.sol is the first smart contract that I ever wrote, and I used to learn the basics of what I needed to create the DevTheGatheringV2.sol, which is the current smart contract used on the DEV: The Gathering application.
